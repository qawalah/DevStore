# DevStore app repo rules (Android)

This app is released through DevStore. Pushing to `main` builds it, and a new
`versionCode` publishes a GitHub Release that installs itself on the user's
phone through Obtainium.

- **Never change `applicationId`.** The phone would treat it as a different app.
- **Bump `versionCode` (+1) and `versionName`** in `app/build.gradle(.kts)` for
  every change the user should receive. No bump means no release (the build
  still runs as a check).
- **Don't add a release `signingConfig`** and don't commit keystores. CI signs
  every release with the DevStore key, or with the app's own key if its repo
  has `DEVSTORE_KEY_ALIAS` set.
- Keep `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat` and `gradle/wrapper/*` committed.
- When a change is done: commit and push to `main`. That push *is* the
  release. If the environment allows it, run `./gradlew assembleRelease` first.
- If the Release workflow fails, read its log in the Actions tab and fix it.
- `HANDOVER.md` (if present) holds history from the original Claude chat.
  Read it before making larger changes.

## Lessons learned
- **Before changing screens, flow or links between devices**, read the shared lessons:
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qawalah/devstore/main/docs/lessons/LESSONS.md`
  (or `docs/lessons/LESSONS.md` in a DevStore checkout). Follow them unless this file says otherwise.
- **Capture.** When a bug, an audit or the owner's feedback shows something a rule would have prevented, add it to
  this repo's `LESSONS.md` in the same change: the rule, then what went wrong, with the date.
- **Feed back.** Mark a lesson that would help other apps with `→ DevStore`. If this session can reach
  `qawalah/devstore` (`add_repo` with push access), add it to DevStore's `docs/lessons/LESSONS.md` under the right
  heading with this app's name and date, push, and change the mark to `→ DevStore (sent <date>)`. If it cannot,
  leave the mark; a DevStore session collects it later.
